# Blackjack
Developed a simplified version of the classic game, Blackjack, using Java. The program allows the player to interact through a console-based interface, enabling them to draw cards, hold their hand, view game statistics, or exit the game. The implementation uses control structures to keep track of the state of the game, calculate results, and manage user input. It features a random card drawing function, and incorporates a system for tracking the player's and dealer's hands, wins, ties, and even calculates the percentage of games won by the player.
